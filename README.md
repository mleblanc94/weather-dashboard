# weather-dashboard
A dashboard that allows a user to see what the weather is in a given area. The application will also save other locations the user has looked up.

## Description

- I was motivated to create this weather finder for locations because I thought it would be very fun to test out APIs and see the power that they have! It has been very fun to see how much data I am able to pull and see the power of using APIs!
- I created this project to work on my javascript skills particularly with using Restful APIs and manipulating the DOM with the responses I receive. This project has taught me a lot relating to this topic.
- By creating this application, I solved the problem of having an application that can easily find a user the weather for a certain area as well as a 5 day forecast. I also myself learned more about APIs and how to properly use them.
- Through doing this activity, I learned more about using javascript and pulling from APIs in real life applications. This knowledge helps a lot to understand all future activities that include pulling data from an API

- When the user enters the application, they are first asked what city or town they would like to see the weather for.
- When a user enters any information into the inputs, they can click submit and see what the weather is for the next few days for this location.
- The user will also have a section on the side that shows them the previous places they had entered and they can click and revisit this.
